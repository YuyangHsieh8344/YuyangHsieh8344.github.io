MIPS Processor Design
Digital Design | January 2022 - May 2022

Designed and implemented a 32-bit MIPS processor using Verilog.
Developed a 5-stage pipelined architecture and supported key MIPS instructions.
Integrated hazard detection and branch prediction mechanisms.
Tools: Verilog, ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado.
Synthesized and verified the design with testbenches, demonstrated functionality on FPGA.


Prototroller – Senior Capstone
Fall 2022 – Spring 2023

Designed and implemented an RP2040 microcontroller PCB and embedded C firmware for low-latency HID communication.
Collaborated in a team of five, focusing on iterative prototyping and user feedback.
Delivered a functional modular controller and comprehensive production artifacts.
